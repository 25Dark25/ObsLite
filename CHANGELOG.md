## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Recordings, replays and screenshots made in the same second no longer write over each other: a
  name already in use gets " (2)", " (3)" and so on.
- A second obs-lite started while the first is recording no longer "repairs" the recording the
  first is still writing, which corrupted it.
- A recording path typed empty or relative in Settings is not taken; recordings went to whatever
  folder obs-lite was started from.
- The settings file is replaced whole, so a crash or a full disk while saving no longer resets
  every setting.
- Windows: when the hardware encoder fails mid-recording (a GPU reset, a driver error), the
  recording stops with the error instead of hanging on "Saving…", or hanging obs-lite on exit.
- Windows: while the encoder was falling behind, a frame could be drawn over before the encoder
  had read it, showing frames out of order or half drawn.
- A recording that cannot be written (a folder that cannot be written to, a full disk, an encoder
  that fails) now stops at once and says why. Before, the timer kept running and the problem only
  showed at Stop, audio for the file piled up in memory, and the file was left unfinished even
  when most of it had been written. Now it is finished, keeping what was recorded until then, and
  the message says where. A replay that fails to save is finished too.
- Linux: a failing encoder or a full disk is noticed while recording; before, every later packet
  queued in memory and the recording was reported as saved, cut short. If the encoder cannot be
  started, the error is shown instead of sharing the screen again and again.
- Windows: capture works again on Windows 10 and on Windows 11 before 24H2. obs-lite asked
  Windows for a minimum time between frames, which only 24H2 and later support, so elsewhere no
  source could be previewed, recorded or captured.
- Windows: a window with an odd width or height is recorded sharp, losing its last column or row,
  instead of being scaled down on every frame with a black line at the edge.
- Windows: a failed preview picture, or a failed copy kept for screenshots, no longer stops a
  recording.
- Windows: windows the desktop hides (suspended Store apps, windows on other virtual desktops) are
  no longer offered as sources or for application audio; capturing them gave no picture.
- Linux: an H.264 encoder that is installed but fails at its first picture no longer makes the
  recording fail: each one is tried on one picture of the recording's size, and the next is used
  if it fails. For example, Ubuntu 24.04's NVENC encoder (GStreamer 1.24) fails with NVIDIA's
  595 driver; obs-lite then uses the next encoder (software if no other works).
- Linux: when the desktop's screen-sharing portal crashes, the capture now carries on: obs-lite
  starts sharing again from the remembered choice, without the dialog, and a recording keeps going
  with the picture frozen for under a second. Before, the preview was lost and a recording
  stopped. COSMIC's portal (Pop!_OS 24.04) crashes every few seconds to minutes. Stopping sharing
  from the desktop, or closing a shared window, still ends the capture.
- Linux: recording failed at once wherever a hardware H.264 encoder was found: the hardware H.264
  encoders (VA-API and NVENC) only take NV12 pictures, and obs-lite gave them I420. Software
  encoding (x264), used where there is no GPU, was not affected.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Recordings survive obs-lite or the PC stopping mid-recording (a crash, a power cut): the MP4 is
  written in fragments and keeps all but the last fraction of a second (about 0.3 s on Windows, up
  to 0.5 s on Linux). The next start turns such a recording into a regular MP4 and says so in the
  status bar. A normal stop still leaves a regular MP4, as before.

### Changed

- Windows: a window resized while recording is scaled down to fit the recording and centred,
  with black around it, instead of cropped or left in the corner. A smaller window is not
  enlarged, so it stays sharp.

### Fixed

- Windows: every recording left about 120 MB of memory behind, so obs-lite grew with each
  one (over 600 MB after five). The hardware encoder kept the GPU device of the recording, with
  its textures, until obs-lite closed; it is now shut down when the recording ends.
- With application audio on, desktop audio no longer includes that application as well: it is
  heard once instead of twice, and muting its channel silences it. Not when desktop audio is set
  to a specific output device.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-24

### Changed

- A newer version is announced in a dialog at start-up, with a button to its download page,
  instead of only a small link in the status bar (which stays). "Don't remind me of this version"
  keeps the dialog away until the next release.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-23

### Added

- Linux version, as a Flatpak (`obs-lite-0.4.0-linux-x86_64.flatpak`): the same interface,
  recording, pause, region, replay buffer, webcam, screenshots, tray icon and global hotkeys. The
  screen or window is chosen in the desktop's sharing dialog (PipeWire, so Wayland works), global
  hotkeys and the webcam go through the desktop, and encoding uses GStreamer (VA-API, NVENC or
  x264). The Flatpak has no network access. Not on Linux: application audio, hiding obs-lite from
  capture and the update notice.

### Changed

- Less CPU while idle: a silent window draws once a second instead of 15 times (it wakes as soon
  as there is sound), each new preview picture draws once instead of twice, and the preview is
  scaled about 40 % faster. Idle CPU fell from 7.4 % to about 4 % of one core on the test laptop.
- While the window is minimized, no preview pictures are made at all.

### Fixed

- Channels that together went over full scale (desktop audio and microphone both loud) were
  clipped, distorting the recording, while each meter looked fine. A limiter now lowers the
  volume at those moments, and the mixer shows *Mix at its limit: lower a volume*.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- Update notice: at start-up obs-lite asks GitHub for the latest release and shows a link in the
  status bar if there is a newer one (Settings › General can turn this off).
- Application Audio Capture source: records the sound of one application, with its own mixer
  channel.
- MSI installer, alongside the portable zip: installs for the current user without administrator
  rights, adds *Obs Lite* to the Start menu and, optionally, to the desktop, and upgrades in place.
- Replay buffer: keeps the last 20 s (configurable) in memory and saves them to an MP4 on demand,
  from the Controls dock, the tray menu or a hotkey. It can run with or without a recording.

### Changed

- New encoding engine: obs-lite drives the Media Foundation H.264 and AAC encoders and the MP4
  writer itself instead of going through MediaTranscoder. Colour conversion and scaling run on the
  GPU's video processor; colours are BT.709 and signalled in the file; a keyframe every 2 s.
  Recording 1080p60 uses about 80 MB less memory.
- Without a usable hardware H.264 encoder, the Windows software encoder is used.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-17

The 0.2.0 release was withdrawn before its files were attached; 0.2.1 includes all of its
changes.

### Changed

- The preview is scaled to the size it is drawn at (up to the source's resolution) with area
  averaging, instead of to 640 pixels by picking one pixel per block, so it is no longer pixelated.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-17 [YANKED]

### Added

- English interface, following the Windows display language or chosen in Settings › General.
- Option to hide obs-lite from screen capture, like OBS Studio's (on by default).
- PNG screenshots of the source at full resolution: File menu, preview context menu or hotkey.
- Configurable global hotkeys, including taking a screenshot and muting Mic/Aux.
- Recording a region of the source, chosen by dragging on the preview.
- Microphone noise suppression (RNNoise).
- System tray icon showing the recording state, with an option to minimize to the tray.
- Webcam overlay (Video Capture Device source) in a chosen corner and size.

### Fixed

- Recordings no longer contain occasional black frames (about one every 15 s in 0.1.0, more
  with a webcam active) or half-drawn frames.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- Screen recorder for Windows with an OBS Studio-like interface (preview, Sources, Audio Mixer and
  Controls docks, status bar, Settings dialog) in Spanish.
- Display and window capture through Windows Graphics Capture, with optional cursor.
- Hardware H.264 encoding to MP4 at a constant 30 or 60 fps, with optional downscaling to 1440p,
  1080p or 720p and three quality presets.
- Desktop audio and microphone capture, mixed into AAC, with per-channel volume, mute, meters and
  device selection.
- Pause and resume without gaps in the recording.
- Global hotkeys: `Ctrl+Alt+R` to start/stop and `Ctrl+Alt+P` to pause/resume.
- Settings saved in `%APPDATA%\obs-lite\settings.json`.
- `--selftest` command-line mode that records through the full pipeline and reports frame counts.
- Minimum supported Rust version: 1.95.
- Releases ship `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.html` with the licenses of the bundled crates.
